# Led-Test
The LEDs are initialized into a pattern with each of the even numbered LEDs only being illuminated. Pressing any of the 8 push-buttons on the STK600 causes the odd numbered LEDs only to light for 0.5 seconds. The LED display then reverts back to the original pattern. The process may be repeated any number of times. (STK 600)
